    "date": "04-02-2026",
    "content": "Update 1.1.0.0 is now available! This update includes a revamped user interface for better usability, a new news section to keep you informed about updates and features, and an indicator to show when an update is available for each application. We've also added a Latest Update section per application to showcase recent changes, and a button to join our Discord server for support and community interaction. Additionally, we've changed the Channel Environment and launch button position for a stacked layout, and fixed an issue where the dropdown menu for selecting the application environment would not remember the last selected option. Enjoy the new features and improvements!"
